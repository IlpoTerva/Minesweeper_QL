# Minesweeper_QL
Minesweeper bot using Q-learning

In this project I am trying to implement Q-learning algorithm for minesweeper game.
With using general Q-learning can be inefficient for game like minesweeper if the minesweeper field is big, since there can be then so many states. Then it is more useful to use for example Deep Q-learning (DQL) which uses deep neural network to estimate the Q values.

I am also implementing DQL algorithm for minesweeper.

This project is in progress and it is not fully completed yet.
